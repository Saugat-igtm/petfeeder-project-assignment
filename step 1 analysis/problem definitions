# Automated Animal Shelter Feeder

## Problem Statement
The local animal shelter requires a low-cost, programmable, and effective feeder machine to dispense food at certain times, monitor it, and alert staff if there is any issue in the machine, including leftover food or failure of the machine.

## Assumptions
- Although this machine can be an effective pet feeder, it has certain limitations, including basic sensors and limited memory capacity.
- It can only dispense one food type at a time.
- It is designed only for dogs and cats.
- The system is totally dependent on the reaction of staff if anything goes wrong.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
* **Feeding Schedule:** A fixed schedule set by the user.
* **Food Level Sensor:** A sensor fitted in the food bin to monitor food levels.
* **Weight Sensor:** A sensor fitted under the food bowl to detect dispensed and leftover food.

### Outputs
* **Servo Motor:** Actuates the mechanism to dispense food.
* **Alert System:** An effective system to notify staff of issues.
